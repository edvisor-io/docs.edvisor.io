# Web 2 Leads

## Getting started

*If you have a wordpress site you can use our plugin to create your form. Please search for 'edvisor' in the wordpress plugins.*

Setting up a web2lead form on your website requires two steps.
First, you must have a form displaying what information you want to collect.
Second, you have to send that information to the Edvisor API. We will do that with Javascript.

Please refer to [Form Data](#form-data) to find out how to structure your data.
